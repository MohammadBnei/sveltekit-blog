This is some of my realisation of the past few years. Most of them started as school project, some of them are still being updated today.

## Voc on steroid

It started as my annual project form my last school year. I wanted to experiment developing a complex microservice architecture, with a lot of technologies. The site is avalaible at [voconsteroid.com](https://voconsteroid.com).

You can check out the blog posts [here](/projects/voconsteroid).

## Alliance search system

I wanted to experiment the possibilities of http/2, specially the SSE (Server Sent Event). So, using a public star wars api, I developed a search app with React, NodeJS and SSE.
