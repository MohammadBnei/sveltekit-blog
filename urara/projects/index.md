This is some of my realisation of the past few years. Most of them started as school project, some of them are still being updated today.

## Passion

I started really developping application in 2018. The first headache I got was on [backboneJS](https://backbonejs.org) while trying to code the front end of a blog. It was such new paradigm, with views and model and events all playing a role in a larger system. I remember clearly going through a haze, not understanding the interaction of the different operations, notably the reactive nature of the event. Then, the fog cleared and I understood how it worked. I fell in love with the dopamine produced at that moment, and that is why I chose to do what brings me joy : coding.
