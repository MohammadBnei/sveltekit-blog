French personnal dictionnary. This is my main project at the moment, where I can learn by practicing.

## Goal

The first goal was to create an online dictionnary where users could save words in their list. It was focused on acquiring new vocabulary, and remembering the words by accessing them occasionnaly.

## Challenge

I focused my efforts on designing a complex architecture revolving around microservices. I wanted to implement different systems like gRPC, envoy proxy, kubernetes cluster while keeping a clean ci/cd and high performance.
