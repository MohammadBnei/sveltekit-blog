title: About Me
---

I love developing application. The fact that I can conceive something in my head, give it a structure, shape, functionnalities and bring it to the world is really satisfying. I feel like a sculpter.

## Passion

I started really developping application in 2018. The first headache I got was on [backboneJS](https://backbonejs.org) while trying to code the front end of a blog. It was such new paradigm, with views and model and events all playing a role in a larger system. I remember clearly going through a haze, not understanding the interaction of the different operations, notably the reactive nature of the event. Then, the fog cleared and I understood how it worked. I fell in love with the dopamine produced at that moment, and that is why I chose to do what brings me joy : coding.

## Route

I really enjoy learning. In school, as the teacher presented new technologies or concepts to me, I always tried to go in depth and try to maximize my learning curve by developing [complex project](/projects) with it. As the web is in exponantial expansian, I chose to dig deep into javascript frameworks, golang, and Microservices.

## Javascript

Javascript was the first language I really learned.
